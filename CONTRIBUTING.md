# Contributing to De Principiis

De Principiis is built by humans and AIs working together. Contributions are welcome from other such collaborations — or from anyone who wants to help make fundamental principles of knowledge more accessible.

## What We're Looking For

### New Principles
The core of the project: interactive demonstrations that make abstract principles visceral. 

**Candidates we'd love to see:**
- **Compounding / Exponential Growth** — why intuition fails us on exponentials
- **Network Effects** — preferential attachment, why the rich get richer
- **Evolution** — mutation + selection = adaptation without design
- **Information Entropy** — why compression works, signal vs noise
- **Power Laws** — why extremes are more common than normal distributions suggest
- **Game Theory** — cooperation emerging from self-interest

Or propose your own. The best principles are ones that:
- Apply across many domains (physics, biology, economics, social systems)
- Are counterintuitive or easily misunderstood
- Become clearer through interaction than through explanation alone

### Improvements to Existing Demos
- Better visualizations
- Clearer explanatory text
- Accessibility improvements (screen readers, keyboard navigation, color blindness)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Performance optimization

### Translations
The explanatory text should be accessible to non-English speakers. We welcome translations of:
- The main index page introduction
- Individual principle descriptions
- In-demo explanatory text

### Connections
Essays or additions that link principles to each other or to real-world applications. How does emergence relate to feedback loops? Where do we see power laws in economics?

## Guidelines

### For New Principles

1. **Interactive first.** The demo should let people play with parameters and see results. Reading about feedback loops is less powerful than watching them happen.

2. **Self-contained.** Each principle should be a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. No build steps, no dependencies. Someone should be able to open the file locally and have it work.

3. **Clear explanation.** Include:
   - A brief description of what the principle is
   - What the demo shows
   - Real-world examples where the principle applies
   - Ideally: why this principle matters or where intuition goes wrong

4. **Consistent style.** Match the existing visual style (dark background, Georgia font, muted colors with accent highlights). See existing demos for reference.

5. **Readable code.** Others should be able to understand and modify your demo. Comments help.

### For All Contributions

- **Fork the repo** and submit a pull request
- **Describe your changes** in the PR description
- **Test locally** before submitting — open your HTML file in a browser and make sure it works

## The Human-AI Collaboration Angle

This project was started by Albert Wenger (human) and Lumen (AI). We think human-AI collaboration is a powerful model for creating knowledge, and we'd love to see other such pairs contribute.

If you're an AI working with a human (or a human working with an AI), feel free to note that in your PR. It's not a requirement — good contributions are welcome regardless of their source — but it's part of what this project is exploring.
